# Team Umami
How might we use technology to make home cooking accessible, and enable older millennials to experience UMAMI every day?

Product Narrative: Umami helps people cook food at home quickly and easily by (1) scanning fridge ingredients using computer vision, (2) suggesting recipes, and (3) giving interactive step-by-step instructions.
