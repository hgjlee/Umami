# Team Umami
How might we use technology to make home cooking accessible, and enable older millennials to experience UMAMI every day?

Product Narrative: Umami helps people cook food at home quickly and easily by (1) scanning receipts using computer vision, (2) suggesting recipes, and (3) giving interactive step-by-step instructions.

We're currently using Swift 4 and the following tech stack:
* Tesseract OCR
* Koloda View
* Alamofire
* Yummly
